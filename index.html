            <h1>About me</h1>
            <img src="img/me.jpg" title="Handsome lad" alt=":(" style="float:top">
            <p><b>Hey there</b>, thank you for stumbling upon my details page, I don't know how to advertise this so you did <i>half the battle</i> by finding it for me! I don't have much to say to start out with, I guess the first interesting thing to note is that I've modeled before, that's me on the catwalk to the left. It's super fun to be up there actually, you only have about 30 seconds of spotlight but it's enough to make the hours of waiting for the night worth it. I don't do much of it anymore thanks to current events but it's for sure a unique experience that everyone should try out if they can!</p>

            <p>Besides being tall and shapely enough to present clothes with, most of my hobbies are pretty nerdy. I've been playing PC games for about a decade now, a hobby that I took after from my dad, who sadly does not spend too much time with the craft anymore. Asides from recreation, computers are also a deep interest in my life, my current major is in Cybersecurity and I've spent a good amount of personal time already studying and learning about the trade before entering UNO. Before I went to University. With all the time I spend wired to a computer though, I try my best to avoid as much social media as I can, which is probably the secret to having a healthy relationship with technology after spending so many thousands hours with it by now.</p>

            <p>A pretty cool fact that's relevant to the class actually is that I've spent a couple years in/out of highschool as a website developer downtown! I had a pretty cool internship opportunity at a web dev company that turned into a part-time job, so I'm not exactly new to web development. I've already dealt with back-end programming with dynamic websites in asp.net, so I can't wait to get into some of the more technical asepcts of the class.</p>

            <h1>Education</h1>
            <p>So far my only completed education so far is highschool (<abbr title="Central High School">CHS</abbr>), which I graduated with a pretty decent weighted grade I suppose, but I never really tried my hardest for high-school because of the broad spectrum in topics. College so far I've been trying nothing but my hardest, it's weird for sure starting out as a freshman in a pandemic but I'm applying myself well to my online classes and have pretty perfect grades so far.

        <div class="sixfifty">
            <h1>Recreation</h1>     
            <p>I'd say I meditate a lot, which counts for recreation. Before I used to have really bad focus and planning, but meditating has significantly helped me developed those skills, so now I try and meditate a good hour a day, but honestly I find myself doing it second nature by now so I have no real idea how much actual time per day I spend on it.</p>

            <p>As for the only safe hobbies I've been able to enjoy right now, I try to spend time researching cyber sec on my own time in tandem with my classes, and I spend a lot of time <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr> gaming for downtime.</p>

                “I look up at the night sky, and I know that, yes, we are part of this Universe, we are in this Universe, but perhaps more important than both of those facts is that the Universe is in us. When I reflect on that fact, I look up—many people feel small, because they’re small and the Universe is big, but I feel big, because my atoms came from those stars.”

                The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start. [funky 90s disco] <b>*DING*</b> 1, <b>*DING*</b> 2, <b>*DING*</b> 3
